## 🥸 About

I am a software developer with a degree in Control and Automation Engineering (Mechatronics) and experience in C++ programming. I have developed several software projects that have aided in the development of the region I lived. In addition, I have created a great number of free software projects that are available on my GitHub and in the Unreal Engine Marketplace. I also have some private and public projects published in the Microsoft Store.

I am committed to becoming a standout programmer by continually improving my skills and also developing solutions that assist other developers and companies in building their projects.
