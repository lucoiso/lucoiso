## About

I am a seasoned software engineer, specializing in C++, and hold a degree in Control and Automation Engineering (Mechatronics).

In addition to my core responsibilities, I am dedicated to continuous improvement. I engage in ongoing learning, experimentation, and the development of cutting-edge tools to support fellow developers.

Known for doing what I love, I stay consistently active and committed. Even years after graduating, my passion for technology drives extensive research, reading, and ongoing study. My goal is to continue growing, striving to be making impactful contributions.
